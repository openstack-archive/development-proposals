Problem description

*Problem Definition*
++++++++++++++++++++
Enabling cloud-native OpenStack deployment, operation and life-cycle management is specifying principles which come out of modern application architecture guidelines to guide application designers in separating out their applications to support running in a more granular and stateless manner conducive to distributed internet based computing. While OpenStack is inherently meant to support this style of application, in many original projects OpenStack was not designed following some of these principles. This user story is meant to assist in identifying, prioritizing and tracking areas of OpenStack to benefit from a redesign.

Opportunity/Justification
+++++++++++++++++++++++++
Scale the key business and technical functions enabled by our software to meet point in time demand. Scaling means designing the functions to operate in small and discrete units that can be instantiated in a manner which can increase and decrease in response to demand. This creates an efficient but operationally flexible and hands off product. 
Requirements Specification

Use Cases
+++++++++


As Adrian - infrastructure architect I need to break out my Open Stack installation footprint to modularized / componentized workloads.  I need a shift from vertical scaling to horizontal scaling in elastic cloud environments supporting small clouds, very large and multi-clouds with a mixture of both.

As Rey - cloud operator, for the purposes of most quickly responding to business growth, need to move from single-threaded designs to multi-threaded designs. This removes single point of contention affinity so throughput can be spread across more resources (CPUs, racks, centers). With a multi-threaded design, the application can better utilize the virtual compute processing platform to achieve the best possible throughput.

As Adrian - infrastructure architect I need to show that OpenStack can multi-task across centers. Similar to application decomposition, databases should be partitioned to small stores that can be hosted and scaled independently. This can be done by partitioning traditional RDBMS (Relational Database) systems into multiple stores based on a logical business partitioning of the data, or by using newer NOSQL and cloud-scalable database solutions that auto-shard or auto-partition across servers. Provides ability to scale data horizontally rather than only vertically. This is needed to improves availability by reducing failure surface for data (failure occurs on one, not many partitions). It is needed to improve scalability by allowing parallelism across multiple compute and storage resources vs. vertical scaling through faster CPUs. It requires smaller code and memory footprint. It reduces I/O requirement impacts.

As Quinn - application developer and Rey - cloud operator,as we don't know at the time the application is developed where various dependent projects will run (different servers or different centers), we need to reduce sensitivity to non-critical latency in app to app service calls to allow more flexible placement in cloud datacenters. (reduce co-location requirements). This will allow more flexibility in geographic location to align with currently available cloud capacity.

As Wei - project owner I need service level performance instrumentation and metrics around each service with automated alerting to capture deviations from expected service levels during migration and post migration to the cloud This ensures that software is performing at expected levels and provides the basis for autoscaling.

As Rey - cloud operator, I need project level automated procedures to ensure the project reports and facilitates software currency (i.e. versions and patches maintained) including underlying cloud services and 3rd party software and tools (n,, n-1…) This facilitates improved portability and adaption to cloud deployments and standards and reduced security risk.

As Quinn - application developer I need the OpenStack Control Plane to have automated service-discovery because new services are deployed dynamically on-demand as they are rolled out and not just on a 6 month tested release basis. This supports the continuous delivery of new control plan functionality without waiting and going through the full release testing and upgrade processes.

Usage Scenario Examples
+++++++++++++++++++++++


**Scenario 1** - Operator expands from 1 to multi-sites
1. Management lets Adrian know that they need to expand cloud operations from the 1 initial site to 3 to support expanded business operations.
2. Rey scans for and analyzes the current production projects for running components and versions and implements copies of the same in new sites though at an initially small footprint.
3. Wei signs in and increases users base and thus expands into the new sites.

**Scenario 2:** Operator needs to rollback after an upgrade
1. Rey upgrades a project to a new version with improvements specified and needed by Quinn - Application Developer
2. Once the upgrade is complete Wei notifies Rey that there is an issue with his workloads in the traditional and older tenants and needs the upgrade rolled back. These same issues are not seen by Quinn who is successfully using the new functions.
3. Rey is able to drop and reinstantiate the previous version for Wei and leave the new function in place for Quinn.
4. Wei monitors and is aware of any service level exceptions in the new sites.
5 Rey monitors and expands underlying resources as the projects auto ramp up in terms of instances to meet demand.

Acceptance Criteria
+++++++++++++++++++
Cloud Infrastructure scales virtualized resources at the VM and container level based on triggers like CPU usage, memory utilization, disk space available and network bandwidth. Cloud Platform automatically detects and responds to elastic conditions defined by the developer. These conditions contemplate business or technical transactions, communications and indicators which are more complex than traditional infrastructure instrumentation.
