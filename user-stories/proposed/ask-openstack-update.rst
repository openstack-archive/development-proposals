Problem description
-------------------
Operators of OpenStack environments lack a reliable source to find answers to
commonly encountered issues. The current ask.openstack.org site is not broadly
functional or well contributed to by the broader community.

Opportunity/Justification
-------------------------
A workable community knowledge base is a critical component of any successful
software. Even more so in free open-source projects. Having a simple place for
operators to go to acquire the collective community knowledge on a given topic
will significantly reduce the barrier to entry to utilizing OpenStack.

Use Cases
=========

User Stories
------------
*As an Operator, I want to be able to quickly find reliable answers to common
operational issues and questions so that I can continue to support my users
*As an Operator, I want to ask an uncommon question in a community forum and
receive an timely answer from the communities expertise so that I can continue to
support my users
*As an Operator, I want to see answers to previously asked uncommon questions and
a notion to the popularity of previous answers so that I can continue to support
my users
