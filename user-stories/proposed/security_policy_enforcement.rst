Problem Description
-------------------

*Problem Definition*
++++++++++++++++++++
Many enterprise has stringent security requirements and the security policy
must be enforced by IT security. Such security policy must be enforced and
applied to all compute resources hosted in the enterprise environment.

Opportunity/Justification
+++++++++++++++++++++++++
TBD.

Use Cases
---------

User Stories
++++++++++++
* As an Enterprise IT security policy maker, I need to ensure that all compute
  resources must adhere to the security policy as defined by the IT security
  department so that the cloud resources are compliant to enterprise rules and
  regulations.

* As an Enterprise IT security administrator, I have to create multiple
  security policy for different corporate department or division. All cloud
  resources provisioned for that particular department or division must be
  applied with relevant security policy. Such policy (e.g firewall rules)
  cannot be removed by the cloud users. A cloud users may add additional rules
  but cannot remove any rules as defined by the IT security administrator.

Usage Scenarios Examples
++++++++++++++++++++++++
The Enterprise IT needs to enforce a corporate-wide or division-wide firewall
policy and rules. This firewall (or security group) must be applied to all
compute resources of a project/tenant within that division. This policy is
defined by the security administrator and must not be removed by the cloud
users.

For example, the security administrator create a security group with a set of
predefined rules. This security group must be automatically applied to all VM
whenever the VM is launched by the cloud users and cannot be removed.

*Requirements*
++++++++++++++
In order to support this user story, we need:

* A method for security administrator to create a firewall or security policy
  and be able to enforce such policy to different project tenant.

* A mechanism to automatically attached the fireall or security policy to
  each network/VM created by the cloud users within the project tenant.

* The rules defined in such fireall/security policy can only be modified by
  the security administrator and must not be removed or modified by cloud
  users. This might requires "role-based access control" to specific type of
  resources and actions.
