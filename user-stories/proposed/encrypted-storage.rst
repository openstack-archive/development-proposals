Encrypted Storage

Problem Description
-------------------

*Problem Definition*
++++++++++++++++++++
Enterprises typically have their own data classification strategies. The types
of data stored typically include (but are not limited to): financial, personal,
health, and confidential business data. Some enterprises (especially finance and
health care industries) have stringent data requirements in order to be
compliant with regional law and regulations.

For example, PCI DSS Requirement 3.4 states that credit card payment details must
be rendered unreadable anywhere they are persistently stored (including portable
digital media, backup media and logs). Applications (including database
back-ends) that interact with these classes of data need to be able to specify
encrypted storage requirements when an application is launched and interacts with
some of these data classes. The data must be encrypted both in flight as well as
at rest. The application should not require administrative privileges to specify
or access encrypted storage.

In addition, proper key management processes need to be in place. The keys used
to encrypt/decrypt the data must be rotated on a regular basis and the access of
keys are restricted to authorized personnel only.

Opportunity/Justification
+++++++++++++++++++++++++
None.

Requirements Specification
--------------------------

Use Cases
+++++++++
* As the Enterprise IT Manager, I must ensure the appropriate security for the
  HR Department database containing employee records that services several
  applications. I would like to migrate the database into our company's
  OpenStack private cloud so that I do not need to maintain the system it
  currently resides on. However, because of the sensitive nature of the
  information in the database our company policy does not allow this
  information to reside on any shared system in an unencrypted form. To be able
  to move the database into the private cloud I need to ensure that the
  persistently stored data and all data in flight to/from the instance is
  encrypted. While the HR Department would like to have improved uptime for
  their database, they are used to having to manually restart/reboot as needed
  and can live with this in the cloud as well.
* I am the Enterprise IT manager for an insurance company. My company
  maintains a database with insurer’s credit card records for annual renewal
  purposes. Our company would like to move the database into our OpenStack
  private cloud. In order to comply with company data classification policy,
  government law and financial regulations, I need to ensure that information
  stored in the private cloud (including backups) is encrypted in flight and
  at rest, and that keys used to encrypt the data are rotated annually.

Usage Scenarios Examples

*Requirements*
++++++++++++++
* A block & object storage solution that enables encryption/decryption at the
  instance source
* A block & object storage solution that enables encryption/decryption for
  data at rest
* A method for the application to specify that it requires a block storage
  system that includes encryption/decryption at the instance
* A method for rotating the key used to encrypt/decrypt the data after a
  specific period of time
* OpenStack services to enforce the storage requirements for the application
* The application needs to be able to specify that it requires an encrypted
  storage system that supports either or both encryption/decryption at the
  instance, in addition to at rest.

*Gaps*
++++++
**Cinder issues:**
* The storage encryption functionality exists, but requires admin status.
Creating encrypted volumes should not require admin status.
* Encryption keys are set at creation time, however it is not clear how to
rotate the key(s), once a volume is in use. Rotating keys is a requirement of
many data storage standards.

**Swift issues:**
* At present an application is responsible for encrypting Objects prior to
calling a PUT operation, swift will store any object that is in the PUT
request. Swift should reject object PUTs that are tagged to be encrypted by
the application.
* Development of a data at rest solution is currently under development,
however, this does not solve for in flight data.


*Affected By*
+++++++++++++
* At the Hong Kong summit there was `a talk`_ on barbican/cinder/nova for this
  type of functionality. Don’t know if it was successfully integrated into
  OpenStack yet.
* There is a `volume encryption spec`_ for some early work and the
  `current documentation`_ implies that admin privilege is required.
* There is an `object encryption spec`_ which documents the approach for object
  encryption (at rest).
