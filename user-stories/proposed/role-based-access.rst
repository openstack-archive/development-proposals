Role Based Access

Problem Description
-------------------

Problem Definition
++++++++++++++++++
OpenStack doesn’t have a hierarchical permission structure that allows an
Operator to assign different permissions for different activities or access to
resources to different users.

Opportunity/Justification
+++++++++++++++++++++++++
Role Based Access is a basic Enterprise requirement. This capability enables
Enterprise IT Managers to set read and write permissions to different elements
of the IT infrastructure for different people/positions in the organization.
Enterprise security requires separate access UI/ API for Network, Security,
Storage management, User Management, and Instance management.

Requirements Specification
--------------------------

Use Cases
+++++++++
* As a cloud operator I want to enable my team to be able to see all Admin
  level alerts, but not to be able to change their status. That requires review
  and approval by the IT manager.

Usage Scenarios Examples
++++++++++++++++++++++++

Requirements
++++++++++++

* Enterprise security requires separate access UI/ API for Network, Security,
  Storage management, User Management, and Instance management.
* Includes grouping actions into roles, assign roles to users, create hierarchy
  of roles, etc.
* OpenStack includes an enforcement piece of access control, but no management
  piece.
* Very important that admin type roles need to be tested thoroughly because of
  the code bleed-in where actions are exposed if  "is-admin".
* As we expand the roles need some tool that can report out on what access the
  newly defined role has - want to make sure you don’t inadvertently create a
  superuser problem (newly created role inherit these rights)

External References
+++++++++++++++++++
From looking at other solutions, generally there are 3 immutable system roles:
administrator, read-only, no-access. With support for specifying roles on
objects and their hierarchy. There is a notion of "folder", data center, host,
VMs on a host, disk etc. Some actions are sort of atomic -- create a disk.
While others encompass multiple steps, needing a variety of privileges. Thus
the role that permits the complex action must contain the full set of necessary
privileges. For example launching a VM needs access to the datastore, OS images
files, disks, ability to create them and/or read an existing one etc.

Gaps
++++
**Keystone**

* Need to add a new role.
* Modify code that makes checks such as context admin, is-admin.

**All Projects**

* Need to review code in other projects to find hardcoded reference to Admin
  and replace them with Keystone references.
* Modify the policy.json file to use this new role. Add test cases to confirm
  behavior is as expected. Code in all projects need to be searched for
  is-admin type tests and code modified to ensure that admin-read-only is
  tested as necessary.
* One approach: Expose the policy.json files of each of the projects via
  horizon and allow it to be modified.
* May need a bug to fix such as: is-admin evaluations to use only roles in the
  code, towards making policy.json the true controller.

**Horizon**

* To expose policy.json via Horizon will need to be allowed to only
  cloud-admins, and any change checked for syntactic correctness at the least.
* Further Horizon today is "pulling" the policy files to determine which
  buttons/links exposed to users to guide them down the correct path.
