Problem description
====================

*Problem Definition*
--------------------
Enterprise users expect a variety of capabilities from their OpenStack clouds.
These include capabilities such as cloud size scalability, cloud usage
scalability and upgradeability. At present some of those capabilities are left
untested, leaving Enterprise evaluators without documented evidence to support
their comparisons to alternatives.

Opportunity/Justification
-------------------------
Providing access to reliable test results which validate OpenStack's
capabilities will increase adoption of OpenStack. Lack of information on
the software's ability to perform in large enterprise environments is a barrier
to adoption for enterprises.
