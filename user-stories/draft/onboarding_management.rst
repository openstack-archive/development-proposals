Onboarding Hosts and VMs into OpenStack for Management
======================================================
**Sections in** *italics* **are optional.**

*Problem description*
---------------------
You have a number of physical hosts and virtual Machines in your infrastructure you would like to manage with OpenStack

* For each host that you wish to manage:

 - Interrogate the hypervisor to obtain a list of all Virtual Machines running in that host 
 - For each storage device attached to the host, obtain a list of all volumes associated with each VM
 - For each VM, obtain a list of all network interface addresses for each VM

* The Onboarding process must be non-disruptive to the operation of the host and the virtual machines running on the host

User Stories
------------
* As the Enterprise IT manager that is deploying an OpenStack cloud alongside my existing infrastructure, I need manage existing virtual machines compute resources with OpenStack without disrupting or changing the virtual machines


* As the Enterprise IT manager that is deploying an OpenStack cloud alongside my existing infrastructure, I need to manage the block storage used by my existing virtual machines into Cinder without disrupting operation of my existing virtual machines


* As the Enterprise IT manager that is deploying an OpenStack cloud alongside my existing infrastructure, I need manage existing virtual machines network resources without disrupting those virtual machines

Usage Scenarios Examples
------------------------
1. Managing existing Virtual Machines
 
	a. For each physical host in a legacy virtualized server environment, Obtain a
	list of all resources (Compute, Memory, Block storage and Network) for each
	Virtual Machine b. Create database entries for each virtual machine in the
	OpenStack so that each of the legacy VMs are managed though OpenStack services
	such as Horizon, Nova, Cinder, Neutron.

Opportunity/Justification
-------------------------
Enterprises with extensive legacy applications environments would like to consolidate management of those environments 
through OpenStack. Due to the nature of the applications and
their value to the business, the onboarding process needs to be non-disruptive
and suitable for use at scale.

The ability to onboard legacy environments is widely desired by any business that
is currently has a legacy IT environment and is using OpenStack to manage new
applications.

Support for onboarding legacy environments in a non-disruptive manner will
greatly increase the adoption of OpenStack.

*Requirements*
--------------
1. Onboarding must be non-disruptive to legacy environments such that the applications, virtual machines and physical hosts should not need to be restarted

*Gaps*
------
* Cinder API to list all volumes
* Cinder API to add volume to database (current “manage_existing” API requires
  too much intrinsic knowledge)
* Nova API to discover VM and all resources associated with it including Memory,
  Processor, Block Volumes
* Nova API to add existing VM to OpenStack database
* Neutron API to add network information to OpenStack database
