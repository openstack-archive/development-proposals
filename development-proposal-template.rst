The title of Development Proposal
=================================
.. In order to propose submitting a Development Proposal as a cross project
.. spec replace 'Cross Project Spec - None' with
.. 'Cross Project Spec - Ready for Submission',
.. after this change is accepted and merged then submit the Cross Project Spec
.. to the openstack/openstack-specs repository and replace 'Ready for
.. Submission' with a link to the review. After the Cross Project Spec is
.. merged, update this entry with the link to the spec as in
.. 'Cross Project Spec - <link>'.
.. Before proposing be sure to create and provide a link to the
.. Feature Tracker.

Cross Project Spec - None

Feature Tracker - None

Problem Overview
----------------
.. This section is mandatory.
.. Please use it to provide a detailed description of the problem that this
.. Development Proposal is trying to address. This should include the types of
.. functions that you expect to run on OpenStack and their interactions
.. both with OpenStack and with external systems.

Mandatory section. See rst comment in this document.

Opportunity/Justification
-------------------------
.. This section is mandatory.
.. Use this section to give opportunity details that support why
.. pursuing this development proposal would help address key barriers to
.. adoption or operation.

.. Some examples of information that might be included here are applicable
.. market segments, workloads, user bases, etc. and any associated data,
.. and any impact if such proposal/feature is not supported.

Mandatory section. See rst comment in this document.

Requirement Specification
-------------------------

Use Cases
+++++++++
.. This section is mandatory. You may submit multiple use cases in a single
.. submission as long as they are inter-related and can be associated with a
.. single epic and/or function.  If the use cases are explaining goals that
.. fall under different epics/themes then please complete a separate submission
.. for each group of use cases.

.. Please provide a unique three character reference and three digit number for
.. each use case.
.. For example, CRM001, CRM002, etc, for use cases of Capacity Management.

.. Please describe as a list of use cases targeted at OpenStack UX Personas,
.. ideally in this or a similar format:
.. * XXX### As `<type of user>`_, I want to <goal> so that <benefit>

Mandatory section. See rst comment in this document.

This section utilizes the `OpenStack UX Personas`_.

.. _OpenStack UX Personas: http://docs.openstack.org/contributor-guide/ux-ui-guidelines/ux-personas.html
.. _<type of user>: http://docs.openstack.org/contributor-guide/ux-ui-guidelines/ux-personas/<type_of_user>

Usage Scenario Examples
+++++++++++++++++++++++
.. This section is mandatory.
.. In order to explain your use cases, if possible, provide an example in the
.. form of a scenario to show how the specified user type might interact with the
.. use case and what they might expect.  An example of a usage scenario can be
.. found at http://agilemodeling.com/artifacts/usageScenario.htm of a currently
.. implemented or documented planned solution.

.. If you have multiple usage scenarios/examples (the more the merrier) you may
.. want to use a numbered list with a title for each one, like the following:

.. 1. Usage Scenario Title
..    i. 1st Step
..    ii. 2nd Step
.. 2. Usage Scenario Title
..    i. 1st Step
..    ii. 2nd Step
.. [...]

Mandatory section. See rst comment in this document.

Acceptance Criteria
+++++++++++++++++++
.. This section is mandatory
.. In order to define completed implementation of a development proposal,
.. provide detailed definitions of acceptance criteria for this proposal.
.. This should include where applicable the specific project set appropriate,
.. the user focused experience and in some cases references to types of
.. specific artifacts.

.. Please reference the use cases by three character and three number
.. references defined above.

.. Ex. ABC123 - All Interop Projects obtain tag "FOO"

Mandatory section. See rst comment in this document.

Related Development Proposals
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
.. If there are related Development Proposals that have some overlap in the
.. problem domain or that you perceive may partially share requirements or a
.. solution, reference them here.
.. N/A if there is none.

N/A.

Requirements
++++++++++++
.. It might be useful to specify additional requirements that should be
.. considered but may not be apparent through the use cases and usage examples.
.. This information will help the development be aware of any additional known
.. constraints that need to be met for adoption of the newly implemented
.. features/functionality.

.. Use this section to define the functions that must be available or any
.. specific technical requirements that exist in order to successfully support
.. your use case. If there are requirements that are external to OpenStack,
.. include them as such.

.. Please always add a comprehensible description to ensure that people
.. understand your need.

.. * 1st Requirement
.. * 2nd Requirement
.. * [...]

.. N/A if there is none.

N/A.

External References
+++++++++++++++++++
.. Please use this section to add references for standards or well-defined
.. mechanisms. You can also use this section to reference existing
.. functionality that fits the Development Proposal outside of OpenStack.

.. If any of your requirements specifically call for the implementation of a
.. standard or protocol or other well-defined mechanism,
.. use this section to list them.

.. N/A if there is none.

N/A.

Rejected Proposals
------------------
.. Please fill out this section after a Development Proposal has been submitted
.. as a cross project spec to highlight any proposal deemed out of scope of the
.. relevant cross project spec.

.. N/A if there is none.

N/A.

Glossary
--------
.. It is highly suggested that you define any terms, abbreviations that are not
.. commonly used in order to ensure that your Development Proposal is
.. understood properly.

.. Provide a list of acronyms, their expansions, and what they actually mean in
.. general language here. Define any terms that are specific to your problem
.. domain. If there are devices, appliances, or software stacks that you expect
.. to interact with OpenStack, list them here.

.. Remember: OpenStack is used for a large number of deployments, and the better
.. you communicate your Development Proposal, the more likely it is to be
.. considered by the community.

.. Examples:
.. **reST** reStructuredText is a simple markup language
.. **TLA** Three-Letter Abbreviation is an abbreviation consisting of three
..         letters
.. **xyz** Another example abbreviation
