https://etherpad.openstack.org/p/BOS-forum-ironic-feedback: 73: * Running DHCP/HTTP/etc for instance provisioning out of the Ironic Conductor machines provides some large security holes. This means that datacenter nodes have logical access to one of the most crucial pieces of the OpenStack control plane. We've moved DHCP, TFTP, HTTP for provisioning to another set of nodes. However the conductor expects to write this to local disk. A driver based interface with an API to write these files remotely is necessary. ##ironic ##painpoint
