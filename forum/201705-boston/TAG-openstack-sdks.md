https://etherpad.openstack.org/p/BOS-forum-openstack-user-api-improvements: 34: The auth plugins are very undocumented - it's a hole- that we VERY much need to fix - for exactly this reason (+1 dims)  (btw - re: gophercloud - I'd very much like to chat with you about things - working on docs about things specifically for you) < Who is this? :) Monty - mordred@inaugust.com LOL Happy to make time to chat. In another forum session at the moment, unfortunately. I'd love to chat as well ("dims" on IRC, Monty's "mordred") Is there a channel to jump in for this conversation? #openstack-sdks+1+1
