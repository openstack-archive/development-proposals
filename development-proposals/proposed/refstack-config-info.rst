Configuration for RefStack
==========================

Cross Project Spec - None

User Story Tracker - None

Problem description
-------------------

Problem Definition
+++++++++++++++++++

Customer decision maker for a choice of OpenStack solution to acquire
often need configuration information that was used for certification
to decide which solution to choose that ensures interoperability with other
openstack environments, and/or portability of applications across OpenStack
solutions.

OpenStack operators would like to setup a configuration for an OpenStack
deployment that provides interoperability support for their users. Thus, they
need information from RefStack about the configuration used for DefCore
certification of vendor solution.

Opportunity/Justification
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

The goal of `Openstack interoperability branding <https://www.openstack.org/brand/interop>`_
is to ensure interoperability between OpenStack clouds to support portability
of applications between them. Unfortunately, this portability is heavily
dependent on full openstack solution configuration that consists of openstack
configuration as well as underlying HW environment configuration.

The proposal is to provide information necessary for operators and decision
makers to decide which configuration(s) and which vendor solution will satisfy
their interoperability requirements. Configuration information requested is
similar to the one that many benchmarking groups, like TPC and SPEC, provide
with their results.

Requirements Specification
--------------------------

Use Cases
+++++++++
This section utilizes the `OpenStack UX Personas`_.

* Private Cloud

  * As a Cloud solution decision maker I want to choose private OpenStack
    solution that meet my application interoperability requirements. Thus, I
    need to ensure that my openstack solution configuration ensures
    interoperability.

  * As a Cloud solution decision maker I want to choose private OpenStack
    solution that meet my application interoperability requirements on hardware
    vendor of my choice. Thus, I need to ensure that solution interoperability
    results are applicable on my hardware choice.

  * As a Cloud solution decision maker I want to choose private OpenStack
    solution for PoC that meet my applications interoperability requirements on
    hardware that is available in my lab now. Thus, I need to ensure that
    solution interoperability results are applicable on my hardware choice.

  * As a Cloud solution decision maker I want to choose OpenStack solution that
    supports multiple hypervisors for my applications and meet interoperability
    requirements for all of them.

  * As As `Rey the cloud operator`_ I want to choose hypervisor for my OpenStack solution
    configuration that provides application interoperability. Thus, as Rey
    I want to see which hypervisor was used by vendor for refstack
    result submissions.

  * As Rey I want to choose container management for my OpenStack
    solution configuration that provides application interoperability. Thus, as
    Rey I want to see which container management was used by vendor
    for refstack result submissions.

  * As a Cloud solution decision maker I want to choose OpenStack solution that
    supports interoperability for bare metal applications.

  * As Rey I want to configure my OpenStack solution configuration
    that ensures bare metal application interoperability. Thus, as Rey
    I want to see what configuration for OpenStack and what hardware
    and its configuration used by vendor for refstack result submissions.

  * As Rey I would like to replicate vendor interoperability
    results. This requiers exact configuration of complete OpenStack solution,
    including hardware choices, its configuration, mapping of OpenStack
    component to hardware and OpenStack configuraion for each OpenStack
    projects.

* Public Cloud

  * As a Cloud solution decision maker I want to choose public OpenStack
    solution that meet my applications interoperability requirements. Thus, I
    need to ensure that public OpenStack solution provider deploys my
    applications on the same OpenStack configuration that was used for DevCore
    Logo certification.

  * As a Cloud solution decision maker I want to choose OpenStack solution that
    supports containers for my applications and meet interoperability
    requirements for them.

  * As Rey I want to choose hypervisor for my OpenStack solution
    configuration that provides application interoperability. Thus, as Rey
    operator I want to see which hypervisor was used by vendor for refstack
    result submissions.

  * As Rey I want to choose container management for my OpenStack
    solution configuration that provides application interoperability. Thus, as
    Rey I wan't to see which container management was used by vendor
    for refstack result submissions.

  * As a Cloud solution decision maker I want to choose OpenStack solution that
    supports interoperability for bare metal applications.

  * As Rey I would like to replicate vendor interoperability
    results. This requiers exact configuration of complete OpenStack solution,
    including hardware choices, its configuration, mapping of openstack
    component to hardware and OpenStack configuraion for each OpenStack
    projects as chosen by vendor. While these choices are not visible to a user
    in public cloud, an identifier for an exact environment that was used for
    RefStack results by the vendor that can be used by the user can be used.
    That covers, hardware choices, openstack projects configuration,
    environment in which it is running, Availability Zone, Host Aggregate,
    High Availability.

Usage Scenarios Examples
++++++++++++++++++++++++

* I want to choose an OpenStack solution

  * I have a list of VM applications that are required to be portable

  * I have a list of docker container based applications that are required to
    be portable

  * I need to provide environment for my dev/QA team to develop portable
    applications

  * I have a short list of preferred hardware partners

  * I review openstack vendors that have foundation logo for interoprability to
    see which ones passed certification on KVM.

  * I review openstack vendors that have foundation logo for interoprability to
    see which ones passed certficiation on docker containers.

  * I review hardware partners logo at OpenStack interoperability list and
    choose ones that meet my container and hypervisor requirements

* I install a chosen vendor OpenStack product as admin in my organization.

  * I review vendor interoperability submission results to configure my
    deployment so it will pass interoperability testing

  * I run refstack interoperability on it as base validation.

  * I run refstack interoperability on OpenStack public cloud that has logo
    interoperability certification, say Rackspace.

  * I compare results between themselves and between refstack results on
    record.

  * If results do not match expectations I send email to interop@openstack.org,
    a ticket get generated and the issue is escalated to proper level for
    resolution.

  * If results are successful, I deploy and run an application on my private
    cloud.

  * I deploy the same application at OpenStack public cloud that has logo
    interoperability certification, say Rackspace.

  * I compare results of two runs to ensure that they are the same.
