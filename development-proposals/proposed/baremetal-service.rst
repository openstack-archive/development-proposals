Problem description

*Problem Definition*
++++++++++++++++++++

In order to support certain Enterprise Business Requirements, OpenStack must
be able to provision bare metal machines in a secure, multi-tenant, and
highly-available fashion, while providing the same integration with other
OpenStack services (such as volume storage, console access, etc) as it does
for virtual machines.

Some use cases for bare metal machines are:

#. Performance-sensitive applications that want to maximize efficiency, reduce
   overhead from virtualization, and avoid CPU, Network, or IO fluctuations
   from neighboring instances.

#. Security-sensitive applications, or applications with regulatory compliance
   requirements that can not be run on shared hardware.

#. Applications whose licensing costs depend on # of CPUs on the Host, regardles
   of whether virtualization is in play.

#. Applications that need direct IO access to specialized PCI devices which are
   not yet virtualizable.

To support these use cases, we need:

#. Bare metal machine configuration: Bare metal machine can be configured with
   CPU specification, memory capacity, local storage drive type such as SATA
   or SSD and it's capacity, and network iplink bandwidth. Infiniband or RoCEE
   may be needed to achieve network performance.

#. Network Isolation: Networks for one tenant is isolated from other tenants.

#. Storage Service Integration: Bare metal machine can be connected with block
   device service such as Cinder. Bare metal machine connects cinder backends
   dedicated to single tenant. Tenant can also back up internal storage of
   bare metal machine to external block device managed by Cinder and recover
   from it.

#. Console: Tenant can operate bare metal machine from console, see console log
   integrated with existing Horizon UI.

#. Unified VM/BM Management: Unified management of both VMs and BMs (Bare
   metal machines) by software with the similar set of services/functionalities
   can be provided to users such as FWaaS, LBaaS, VPNaaS, Security Group,
   Block Storage, Backup, High Availability, Connection to VMs in virtual
   network (VXLAN), and Console.

Opportunity/Justification
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

Cloud service providers want to support bare metal machine, but it is a tough
challenge to provide IaaS access to bare metal with the same elastic and
service-oriented properties as they do with virtual machines.

Requirements Specification
--------------------------

Use Cases
+++++++++

* BMT001 - As an Enterprise user, I want to use bare metal machine so that I
  get consistent performance not affected by another machine, nor impacted
  by hypervisor.

* BMT002 - As an Enterprise user, I want to have a secure and clean bare
  metal machine deployed no matter who used it before.

* BMT003 - As an Enterprise user, I want to create networks elastically so
  that I can use network like I have these networks not affected by other
  companies.

* BMT004 - As an Enterprise user, I want to back up internal disk of bare
  metal and create a snapshot. This can be backed up to an external storage
  managed by Cinder.

* BMT005 - As an Enterprise user, I want to use bare metal machine
  integrated with block storage service so that I can use external
  storage service.

* BMT006 - As an Enterprise user, I want to see bare metal machine from
  console log and operate from console so that I can analyze problems at
  booting time and so on.

* BMT007 - As an Enterprise user, I want to continue my operation
  immediately when a bare metal machine fails without any manual
  operations such as switchover. Similar to HA VM user story, The user
  should not have to design the fail-over mechanism themselves. The system
  should monitor and detect bare metal machine failure and automatically
  fail-over to a spare bare metal machine.

* BMT008 - As an Enterprise user, I want to use a bare metal machine with
  the network services such as FWaaS, LBaaS, Security Group, VPNaaS, and
  connection to VMs in virtual network(VXLAN) in the same manner of VMs.

Usage Scenario Examples
+++++++++++++++++++++++

1.Successful bare metal service
  a. Enterprise user creates virtual network.
  b. Enterprise user boots bare metal machine.
  c. Enterprise user uses block storage from bare metal machine.
  d. Enterprise user uses bare metal machine with consistent performance.

2.Analyze bare metal machine rebooting problem
  a. Enterprise user can't connect to bare metal machine remotely when rebooting.
  b. Enterprise user can see state of bare metal machine from console log.
  c. Enterprise user analyzes boot problem and resolved the issue.
  d. Enterprise user can boot successfully.

3.Bare metal machine data protection
  a. Enterprise user backs up data in bare metal machine.
  b. Enterprise user restore from data backed up.
