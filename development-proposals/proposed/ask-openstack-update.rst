Problem description
-------------------

Problem description
+++++++++++++++++++
Operators of OpenStack environments lack a reliable source to find answers to
commonly encountered issues. The current ask.openstack.org site is not broadly
functional or well contributed to by the broader community.

Opportunity/Justification
+++++++++++++++++++++++++
A workable community knowledge base is a critical component of any successful
software. Even more so in free open-source projects. Having a simple place for
operators to go to acquire the collective community knowledge on a given topic
will significantly reduce the barrier to entry to utilizing OpenStack.

Requirements Specification

Use Cases

* As `Rey the Cloud Operator`_, I want to be able to quickly find reliable
  answers to common operational issues and questions so that I can continue to
  support my users

  an timely answer from the communities expertise so that I can continue to
  support my users
